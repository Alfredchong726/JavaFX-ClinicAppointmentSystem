## Getting Started
This system is a clinic appointment system.

## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Remark
This system is developed on vscode, if need to run in vscode, the `.vscode/settings.json` file is important, or else can just remove it.

> If need to run in other text editor, i also not sure can work or not, especially netbean and IntelliJ. You may need to do some research through internet.

## Dependency Management
The dependencies are already in the lib folder
